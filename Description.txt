Setup:  
Initial stage will see the user place the game obstacles on the field. U for user spaceship, R for robot
A for asteroid and M for intially inactive mine.

Rules : 
User can move onto inactive mines in order to activate them. The mine explodes if a robot comes too close, destroying any nearby robots and asteroids.
It is the robots job to remove any inactive mines from the playing field.
If the robot is next to inactive mine the robot must move to the mine, thereby removing it.
Otherwise, if the user is a square away from the robot, the robot must move onto the user thereby ending the game with the user's loss.
The robot wins if the user is destoryed and there are still robots on the field.
The user wins if the robots are destroyed by active mines.
The game is a draw if the user is alive and the mines are removed from play.
User uses aswd to move.
User or robot may not move to asteroid space.


Known flaws:
